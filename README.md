## Vem Ser Tech

Vem Ser Tech was a course offered by a partnership between the companies Ada Tech and iFood. Each student was offered one subject among 4 possibilities: Front-End, Back-End, DevOps and Data. I chose the Back-End technology track, which aimed to study the JavaScript language divided into 6 modules:

Module 1: Programming Logic

Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming

Module 3: Database

Module 4: Node.js with Express (intermediate level)

Module 5: Node.js with Express (advanced level)

Module 6: Automated Testing

The course lasted about 6 months with synchronous classes every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, from 7pm to 10pm, between October 6, 2023 and March 23, 2024. You can find more information about this course here: <a href="https://ada.tech/sou-aluno/programas/ifood-vem-ser-tech">Vem Ser Tech</a>

## Purpose 

At the end of the fifth module, each student was challenged to build a RESTful API. So, I decided to build an API to be used at the dance school called 123 Studio. This API was built using the nodejs framework and several concepts were applied such as middleware, authenticated routes through jwt token and database administration through mongoose as ODM (Object Document Mapping) to manage the MongoDB database.

More about the specified requirements for this project can be read in the document below written by the module professor.

## Requirements

RNF01 This project must be developed in the format of a RESTful API.

RNF02 This project must be developed in the Javascript language, using the
Express library.

RNF03 It is necessary to use a database, which can be relational
(EX: MySQL) or non-relational (Ex: MongoDB).

RNF04 Any and all forms of authentication must be done through JWT's
(JSON Web Tokens).

RNF05 Structuring the RESTful API (EX: controllers, routes, database, dao, config,
server, .env)

All CRUD operations must be performed on the database (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT)
